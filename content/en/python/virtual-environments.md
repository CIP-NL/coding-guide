In python, namespaces can be polluted easily. Also your computer might
be running different versions of python, most likely 2.7 and 3.6. Virtual 
environments are the best way to manage this.

## Virtual environment
Many guides have already been written on virtual environments. I like this 
[one](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).
